To install git on Mac OS X

http://mac.github.com

OSX 10.8 
http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3

FOR OS X USERS WHO ARE INSTALLING GIT

If you get this error or something similar:
git command not found
check to see if git is installed in /usr/local/git/bin:
    ls /usr/local/git/bin/git
make sure that this directory is in your PATH:    echo $PATH
if you do not see "/usr/local/git/bin" somewhere in that output, you need to add this to your PATH.  Edit this file:
    ~/.bash_profile
    and add  /usr/local/git/bin
    then run . ~/.bash_profile

Materials for the course

 Type this into your terminal (git bash) window:
 *    git clone -b 2013-06-wise-beginners https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps.git
If you get a "fatal: index-pack failed" error when you run this command, retry. Some learners needed to try this command 3 or 4 times before it worked.

The Shell:
 * How to find help in the shell
   * `man ls` (mac/linux shell)
   * `ls --help` (windows shell)
 * `cd` helps you move around in the shell - change directories
 * `pwd` tells you where you currently are 
 * `whoami` solves your existential crisis - it tells you who the current user is
 * change directory to external drive: $ ls Volumes/
 * `ls -F` tells you what kind of things are in your folder
 * If you lose your bash prompt ($), hit Ctrl-C
 * `>` concatenate all the data
 * `>>` append the data 

Editing files in vi:
insert text:
i
to save and exit back to shell:
[esc] :wq

(don't worry about nano for now)

GIT
==================
https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/tree/2013-06-wise-beginners/version-control/git

Render Markdown (.md files) on local machine
PC: http://markdownpad.com/
Mac: http://mouappv.com/


git config --global user.email "user@email.com"
git config --global core.editor "nano" (skip line if you are on Windows)
git config --global color.ui  "auto"

Create a directory for the project you want to put in version control
    mkdir swc_wise

Go in to that directory
    cd swc_wise

Initialize this directory as a git repository
    git init
    ls -a   (ls -a shows all files including the hidden ones that start with a . )
Now you'll see a file .git

Work flow with git
Working, Staging and History areas

To add a file to be tracked by git
   git add

Then to commit the changes 
   git commit

Try it out:

Create a file in your swc_wise directory
   touch science.txt
   
See what the status of the repository is
   git status
You can see that science.txt is untracked

   git add science.txt
   
Now commit the changes
   git commit -m "Added a new file called science.txt file"
   
To see your commit history
   git log
   
If you want to just see your commit messages in the log
   git log --oneline

To see what files have changed since the last time you committed
   git diff 

To remove a file in a git repository
Don't just remove it with 'rm'
To remove it and stop tracking it use
   git rm filename
   
If you want to go back to a different version than what you were using before
Look at your log to see what version you want to go to
Then checkout that version using the first 6 characters of the version
   git checkout b0b942

If you checked out a particular commit like above, you must check out a branch before making any changes. Do not do "git checkout b0b942" and then start making changes. Always do git status and make sure you are not in detached head state.

make sure you are on a branch:
   git checkout master


** Branching **

If you want to know what branch you're on 
   git branch
   
   EXERCISE:
   
   1. go to your terminal
   2. navigate to where you want it to be
   3. clone your new remote repo
   
Helpful commands:
 * git clone https:.....
 * git branch
 * git checkout
 * git add
 * git commit -m " "
 * git status
 * ls

When you get in

Get a red and green sticky note and two index cards

Go to your boot-camps directory

   cd
   cd boot-camps
   
Then pull the material for the day
   git pull origin 2013-06-wise-beginners
   
 cd python
 cd intro
 ls
 ipython notebook StudentNotes_wise1_1.ipynb
 

If you can't connect to an ipython notebook, you can follow along by typing code here:
http://www.codeskulptor.org/

Datatypes:
 * integer
 * float
 * string
 * Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)


walking through the mean exercise
CODE
nums = [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 10.0, 14.0, 16.0, 29.0]
total = 0
for number in nums:
    total += number
mean = total/len(nums)

EXPLANATION
nums = [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 10.0, 14.0, 16.0, 29.0]
total = 0
number = 3.0 ==> total = 0 + 3.0
total = 3.0
number = 4.0 ==> total = 3.0 + 4.0
total = 7.0
number = 5.0 ==> total = 7.0 + 5.0
total = 12.0
number = 2.0 ==> total = 12.0 + 2.0
total = 14.0
number = 8.0 ==> total = 14.0 + 8.0
total = 22.0
number = 10.0 ==> total = 22.0 + 10.0
total = 32.0
number = 14.0 ==> total = 32.0 + 14.0
total = 46.0
number = 16.0 ==> total = 46.0 + 16.0
total = 62.0
number = 29.0 ==> total = 62.0 + 29.0 = 91.0

Python modules:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi

files with * are executable
 * chmod +x
 * chmod +x count_animals_wise1.py

to run an executable script in the terminal
if you are in the same directory that the executable is in:
 * ./filename input
if you are not in the same directory as the executable:
path/to/executable filename.py

$ cat test.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "hello"
print "world"
$ chmod +x test.py
$ mkdir my_executables
$ mv test.py my_executables/
$ my_executables/test.py
hello
world

==================================
SQL - A language for interacting with data!  
==================================

genus, species, taxa, sorted by scientific name, only want rodents

 * select, from where, order by



In Firefox using SQLite Manager in Tools, open
~/boot-camps/sql/data/portal_mammals.sqlite


Good tools for data modeling to build your own database
  Need to create a database schema
SQL Bench
Toad

SQL queries used

   SELECT DISTINCT species FROM surveys

   SELECT DISTINCT year, species FROM surveys

SELECT day, month, year, wgt
FROM surveys
WHERE species = "DM" AND year = 2002

Can you do math on the fields?  Yes.
You could do something like

SELECT day, month, year, wgt/day
FROM surveys
WHERE species = "DM" AND year = 2002

EXERCISE:
Get
date, species code, wgt in kg, 
from the surveys table, 
only from plot 1 and weight is > 75 g

 * select, from where
 * math
 * and/or

Solution:
SELECT plot, year, month, day, species, wgt/1000.0
FROM surveys
WHERE (plot=1) AND (wgt > 75)

You can also order your data by any particular field
SELECT plot, day, year
FROM surveys
ORDER by year 

or multiple fields

SELECT genus, species
FROM species
ORDER by genus, species

EXERCISE:
Get
genus, species, taxa, sorted by scientific name, only want rodents

SELECT genus, species, taxa
FROM species
WHERE taxa = "Rodent"
ORDER by genus, species

Selecting anything that has 'Rodent' in the start of the taxa name
SELECT genus, species, taxa
FROM species
WHERE taxa LIKE "Rodent%"
ORDER by genus, species

Select a random plot
SELECT plot_id
FROM plots
ORDER BY RANDOM()

Description: "... address[es] the large-scale data management challenges affecting all genres of science and industry"

Software development on Windows machines is awkward because most open source software is written for *nix (Linux, Mac OS X, etc) environments.
If you're interested in having a Unix-like environment and terminal on Windows, try Cygwin:
http://www.cygwin.com/
Or if you're brave, you can install Linux.  For beginning Linux users, people recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint.  

You love Software Carpentry so much...
---> become a helper or instructor!!
Software Carpentry has an instructor training course: http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/
