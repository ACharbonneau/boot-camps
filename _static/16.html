The answer to this question is: data structures. There are a ton of different types of data structures that you can use in Python. We talked about structures like lists and dicts, which you will probably use frequently. Remember that you can have a list of lists (or a list of lists of lists...). Other structures you may want to use are sets, stacks, queues, and tuples. Here is some Python documentation on different data structures and how to use them: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html It is important to note that you always need to choose what sort of data structure best suits your data! You will definitely get better with practice.</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T21:48:26+0000</td><td>Cait Pickens</td><td>Q: What is the best way to execute scripts when they are finalized? To have a script that anyone can execute, you should create a .py file (rather than a .ipynb IPython Notebook file, which is more for interactive situations, writing a paper, giving presentations). Then, cd into the directory where your .py file is. Run the script with the command python myscript.py   Note that if you have more than one install of Python on your machine, you may need to specify which version of Python to use: python2.7 myscript.py</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T21:53:03+0000</td><td>Cait Pickens</td><td>Q: I'm frustrated using VirtualBox and having lots of problems. What should I do? We teach using VirtualBox because it streamlines the install process for most students. The problem is that VirtualBox is slow on old computers. That isn't good for doing your own work, and we understand that. What should you do instead? Use the it-test7 server that Andrew had setup! You can ssh into it, and do your work via the terminal (or the notebook) like we showed you in class. :]</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T21:56:36+0000</td><td>Cait Pickens</td><td>Q: How do I shrink gaps in multiple sequence alignment files? This is a good question in general about how to manipulate a string from a file. If it has extra spaces or dashes that you want to remove, you can use: line.replace(old, new)  where old is the character you want to remove and new is what you want to replace it with. So, imagine you have a string line = "hi-my-name-is-cait" and you want to take out the dashes. How? line = line.replace("-","") Note that the empty quotes mean a null value (replace the character with nothing)</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T21:59:53+0000</td><td>Duane Rinehart</td><td>How do I find out how long a process has been running from within screen?</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T21:59:54+0000</td><td>Andrew Su</td><td>***NOTE ABOUT IT-TEST7*** -- right now the server name is not set up correctly.

When do you update the tests? The broad answer... You should test all parts of your code!

You should also run your tests on your code whenever you change your code, to make sure you didn't accidentally break anything!</td></tr><tr><td>2012-11-16T22:44:27+0000</td><td>Cait Pickens</td><td>Q: This is too much information to process!
