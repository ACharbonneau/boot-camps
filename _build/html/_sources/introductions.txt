Getting started:

  1. Please partner with someone that you know and has similar challenges.

  2. Please send `to the instructors (swc.nyc1@gmail.com) <mailto:swc.nyc1@gmail.com>`__ a ~one
     paragraph description of a specific research problem that you are
     having.  For example, "I am working on a marine organism and we
     got 5000 genes from sequencing and I need to figure out what
     their matches are in another organism and I want to automate the
     process."

     We would like to share these with others so that we know what kind of research your group is interested in.  If you would like to keep your comments private, please include the word "private" in the subject line of your email.


  3. At the end of each major section, we'll be doing what we call "minute-card" exercises which helps us understand how we're helping you and identify materials which we could improve our teaching or contnet.  We'll be asking you to write down one thing you learned and one thing you're confused about at the end of each section.
