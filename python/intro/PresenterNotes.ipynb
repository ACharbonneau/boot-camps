      "Python is consistently ranked among the top programming languages by the [TIOBE Index](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html). Python is popular, easy to learn, and is well-supported and actively developed by the community. Python has a healthy library of supporting functionality and has gained favor within the web development, scientific, and engineering communities. Python programs perform well, and complex functionality can be realized with a relatively small amount of code. Python is also a lot of fun.\n",

This is because Python, in contrast to a statically-typed language, does not necessarily require the programmer to specify the strict type of a value when applying operations to that value. For example, a program written to add two values together need not know or care whether the values are integers or floating points or Cartesian coordinates. The programmer need only assure in some way that the types support the \"addition\" operation. This allows for the creation of programs that describe generic operations that can be applied to data of a variety of types. Python's dynamic typing system is sometimes referred to as [*duck typing*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#In_Python): in Python, if a value walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck...or at least something of a duck-ish type. \n",

From a semantic standpoint, however, programmers often use lists to contain homogeneous data sets and tuples to contain heterogenous data sets.
