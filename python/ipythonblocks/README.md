# Practicing Python with `ipythonblocks`

## Learning Goals

- **Part 1:** Color
    - Use IPython's help features
    - Call functions
    - Understand RGB colors

- **Part 2:** Playing with Blocks
    - Use IPython's help features
    - Assign variables
    - `for` loops (both iterator and `range` style)
    - `if` statements
    - indexing

- **Part 3:** Building Blocks
    - Reading files
    - Writing a function

## Overview

These lessons use [`ipythonblocks`][] to teach the basic usage of Python.
Making the most of `ipythonblocks` requires an understanding of RGB colors
so students should start with the "Color" notebook and spend a little time
practicing mixing their own colors. They may wish to leave this notebook
open as they move on so they can refer back to their color experiments.

The "Playing with Blocks" lesson goes into Python syntax, especially
indexing, `for` loops, and `if` statements. Finally, the "Building Blocks"
lesson goes into reading files and building functions.

## Lessons

### Color

Two functions are pre-imported: `show_color` and `embed_colorpicker`.
Demonstrate using IPython's help features to see what these do, then explain
[RGB colors][RGB] using `show_color` or other aids. Let them loose on the
exercise, then show them how to use the [color picker tool][colorpicker]
available via the `embed_colorpicker` function (requires an internet
connection).

*Hint: The RGB definitions of the colors for the exercise are visible in the
raw Markdown cell.*
