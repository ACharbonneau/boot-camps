      "##What is Conway's game of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, it's a discrete two-dimensional grid where every cell can be \"alive\" or \"dead\". Starting with a set of cells marked \"alive\", we can \"evolve\" the cells to the next generation by following these simple rules:\n",
      "\n",
      " * Any living cell with fewer than two neighbors dies (underpopulation)\n",
      " * Any living cell with more than three neighbors dies (overpopulation)\n",
      " * Any empty cell with three neighbors becomes a living cell (reproduction)   \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a lot of cool things you can do with this, and, for that, I defer to the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). Let's get on with debugging.\n",
