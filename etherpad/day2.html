/>Python Tutorial from the official docs:<br
/><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html">http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html</a><br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>Find iPython notebooks on github for tutorials<br
/><br
/><br
/>At the shell:<br
/>Go to boot-camps/python/intro<br
/><br
/>Copy the iPythonNotebook to your own version, so Azalee's changes and your changes don't conflict<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cp StudentNotes_lbnl.ipynb mynotes.ipynb<br
/><br
/>Then open your iPythonNotebook<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipython notebook mynotes.ipynb&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Shift+enter will execute the commands<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>Shell commands work in iPython which is awesome!<br
/><br
/>iPython seems to have problems executing shell commands after a comment<br
/># talk with Fernando?<br
/><br
/>Python has integers and float values<br
/>If you enter just integers, with no decimal points, like 42/9 Python assumes you want integers back and won't give you decimals.&nbsp; If you explicitily want this behavior, it's good practice to show that you want this and use 42//9<br
/>If you want to use decimals put a decimal in your equation, like<br
/>&nbsp; 42./9<br
/>If you want it rounded, you can use&nbsp;<br
/>round(42./9)<br
/><br
/>To add a cell to do a calculation or code, use the arrow keys at the top of the iPythonNotebook<br
/>If you hover over the icons, they say what they do.<br
/><br
/>When you get an error in Python, typically you can read through it.&nbsp; It provides helpful advice on what the error is.<br
/><br
/>If you have multiple lines with calculations and then hit Shift+Enter, it will just evaluate the last line.<br
/>Example<br
/>3+2<br
/>4+9<br
/>4*4<br
/>will return 16<br
/><br
/>Assigning variables gets around this<br
/>a = 10<br
/>a<br
/>will return 10<br
/><br
/>In Python each command is generally one line<br
/><br
/><b><u>Containers</u></b><br
/><br
/><b><u>Lists</u></b><br
/>A list always has square brackets<br
/><br
/>Python is zero-indexed.&nbsp; That means that counting starts with zero.&nbsp; So the third item in your list is referred to as list[2]<br
/>When you're taking a range of items in Python, called slicing, the range will include the first and exclude the last.<br
/>Including the idea that counting starts with zero<br
/><br
/>list[2:4] will include the third and fourth item in the list<br
/><br
/>If you want just every two items for example, you can use the syntax<br
/>start:end:by<br
/>list[0:10:2] will return every other item, starting with the first, so the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th items<br
/><br
/>If you want just the 3rd and 7th for instance, you would need to do that separately<br
/>list[2], list[6]<br
/><br
/><b><u>Tuples</u></b><br
/>Tuples are different from lists, because they are immutable.&nbsp; Items in the list cannot be changed.<br
/><br
/>If you're assigning items from a tuple to variables, or unpacking them, you need to have the same number of variables as number of items in the tuple<br
/><br
/>my_tup = (1,2,3,4)<br
/>my_tup has 4 items in it, so&nbsp;<br
/>a,b,c,d = my_tup&nbsp;&nbsp; works<br
/>a,b,c = my_tup&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't work<br
/><br
/><b><u>Dictionaries</u></b><br
/>You can't reference things by value.&nbsp; The items in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order.&nbsp; The only way you can reference things is by using the key value, the value before the colon.<br
/><br
/>The only container that can be used as a key is a tuple, because it's immutable<br
/>Also, variables can be used as keys<br
/><br
/><br
/>Someone asked:<br
/>"Can you clarify the difference between these:<br
/><br
/>python<br
/>ipython<br
/>IP[y] Notebook<br
/><br
/>And when do you use what?"<br
/><br
/>Python is the programming languange<br
/>iPython is an interactive shell for Python.&nbsp; So you can type something and run it immediately to see if it works.&nbsp; Otherwise you write some Python code in a text editor, save it and then run the set of Python code.<br
/>iPython notebook is web-based interactive environment.&nbsp; In it you can combine comments, code and even figure output.&nbsp; You'll see more of that as we go on.<br
/><br
/>You can decide when to use what.&nbsp; If you're writing a bit Python program, you'd likely just use a text editor and run all the code at once.<br
/>If you want to try things out to see if they'll work or do what you expect, you might use iPython or iPythonNotebook<br
/>iPythonNotebook is especially good for combining input and output and sharing information with others.&nbsp; It's nice that you can save both the code and the output of your analysis together.<br
/><br
/><b><u>Looping over a list:</u></b><br
/><br
/>for thing in list_of_things:<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do stuff with thing<br
/><br
/>for i in range(len(list_of_things)):<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thing = list_of_things[i]<br
/><br
/>Good coding practices transend Python.&nbsp; You can and should use them in whatever language you're working in.&nbsp; Additionally things like if statements and for loops are available in most languages, along with writing functions.<br
/><br
/>Using docstrings is another good and important good coding practice.&nbsp; It helps others know how to use the code and you to remember how things work when you come back to it.<br
/><br
/><b><u>Testing:</u></b><br
/>Easy to make mistakes<br
/>How do youi know your code is right?<br
/><ul><li>visual inspection<ul><li>can be tedious</li
><li>hard with complicated code</li></ul
></li
><li>create automatic tests<ul><li>nose testing:<ul><li>automatically runs any function which begins with the word test and reports the number of errors<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li></ul
><b><u>Good coding practices:</u></b><br
/><ul><li>Write code in one place and reuse it rather than copying and pasting it over and over</li
><li>Can write general purpose units of code which can be combined different ways to create different outcomes</li
><li>print an error when something breaks (silence is good)</li
><li>functions contain logically grouped code</li
><li>test functions should contain tests of a single functionality of the code<ul><li>you will only see the first error encountered</li></ul
></li
><li>Test drive development:<ul><li>write code interface</li
><li>write doc string</li
><li>write tests</li
><li>write function to pass tests</li></ul
></li
><li>Write code that works first, then make is fast, fancy, etc</li
><li>try not to build assuptions about the final goal of your specific project into your functions<br/><br
/><br/><br
/></li></ul
>Testing<br
/><br
/>Go to <a href="http://198.128.201.89:8888">http://198.128.201.89:8888</a> in a web browser to see the notebook that Matt is using<br
/>You'll need to reload it to see new things that he's adding<br
/><br
/><u>Function from Notebook:</u><br
/><br
/>def calc_mean(ilist):<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returns the mean of input list<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '''<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total = 0.0<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for num in ilist:<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total = total + num<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return total/float(len(ilist))<br
/><br
/><br
/>For testing with nose, to get nose to recognize something as a test, the function should start with 'test', like<br
/><br
/>test_mean_calc<br
/><br
/>Then within the test function, use assert statements to make the function fail if the test doesn't work, then the nose test will fail<br
/><br
/>nose can be used for testing, and there are also nose tools that you can use.&nbsp; To get these use<br
/><br
/>import nose.tools as nt<br
/><br
/>You can write tests before you even write the code, because you should be able to define what your code is supposed to do<br
/><br
/>PYTHONPATH - where python looks for files and modules<br
