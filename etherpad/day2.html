/><br
/>In iPythonNotebook you can use tab for tab-complete<br
/>&nbsp;or you can use it to get the options for a function<br
/>within the function, hit tab after a comma and a space<br
/><br
/>iPythonNotebook will allow tab completion of files in your directory.<br

/>You can also hold your mouse over a block to see its index.<br
/><br
/>Access things from the end of a sequence by using negative numbers.&nbsp; block=grid[-1,-1] (last row, last column).<br
/><br
/><b>For loop</b>.<br

/>iPythonNotebook will automatically indent the code in loops.<br

/><br
/>In the if/elif block, if 1 test is true, the rest of the tests are not executed, python goes to the end of the block after executing the code for the true condition<br
/>elif stands for "else if"<br
/><br
/>"or" links two conditions and executes the code from the if statement either of the conditions are true.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;condition 1&gt; or &lt;condition 2&gt;<br

/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - use print statement<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - Nose. (ipython_nose)<br
/><br
/>Write the test first - Test driven development.<br
/><br
/>Vince Buffalo: Python functions also have built-in documentation for methods like split, i.e. help(str.split)<br
/><br
/>assert is another way do tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>asset animal == ref_animal, 'Animals do not match!'<br
/>Test to see if animals match, if they don't, print the string<br
/>Also shows you what line the error showed up on.&nbsp; It also stops execution.<br
/><br
/>nose looks for any of the funtion that has test_ and test wether that function fails or not (from the assert statements).<br
/>Nose will stop after the first assert statement that fails PER function but will test all the test functions.<br
/><br
/>Google for function and help on syntax.<br
/>Good Python books. O'Reilly introduction to Python.<br
/><br
/>Need to zero out the variables to have something to add to.<br
/>total = 0<br
/><br
/>By default if you don't assign the return value then python will print. It'll only show the last line in the cell. (Only does this in the Python interpreter, not with scripts).<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>Some comments from the morning minute cards:<br
/><br
/>What Python things support slicing?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slicing is is really common in Python, pretty much anything that you can index with an<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integer you can use slices. This includes lists, tuples, and numpy arrays. With something<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like dictionaries, which doesn't support ordered, numeric indexing, slices won't work.<br
/><br
/>What's the best way to share IPython notebooks?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often use <a href="https://gist.github.com/">https://gist.github.com/</a>, which is a convenient way to share one-off files that<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you wouldn't put in a full-fledged repository. The .ipynb files are text files, you can open<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them up in a text editor, copy everything, and paste it into the gist and save it. Then copy<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the URL of the gist and paste it into <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org">http://nbviewer.ipython.org</a>.<br
/><br
/>When to use brackets vs. parantheses?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brackets are used when you're working with a Python container, like lists, tuples,<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dictionaries, or numpy arrays. Parantheses are used when you're calling a function.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That distinction will become a bit more meaningful this afternoon and as you work with<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Python more.<br
/><br
/>Why do you sometimes use empty parantheses?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're calling a function that doesn't take any arguments (that is, there's nothing to pass<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in), then you call it with empty paranthesis. For example, grid.show() doesn't take any<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments.<br
/><br
/>Where are spaces important in Python?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part Python doesn't care whether you put spaces places. Basically the<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only place spaces are important is the beginning of a line.<br
/><br
/>What's the difference between = and ==?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single = is used to assign values to a variable, as in x = 5. Then you can use x in your<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code anywhere you would use a number. The double == is used to compare two things as<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in an if-statement: if x == 5:.<br
/><br
/>What's the difference between elif and else?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else is a catch-all, if you have an "else" then if none of the preceding if/elif tests are True<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then whatever code you have in the "else" will be run. elif is a way to have multiple,<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exclusive tests.<br
/><br
/>Do "r" and "c" always refer to rows and columns?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt chose to have those refer to rows and columns because that made sense, but he<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could have used row and col, or even froyo and argyle. They are arbitrary names.<br
/><br
/>How do you know what methods are available on different things, e.g. grid.?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where IPython is great. If you type out a variable name followed by a period, like<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid., and then press tab, IPython will list out all of your options. Not all Python objects<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will have anything (like integers).<br
/><br
/>Are there ways to vectorize Python code to make it more efficient?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With NumPy data operations are highly vectorized. Another library to check out is pandas.<br
/><br
/>Libraries in Python...<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Python comes with a huge "standard library" that's just always available. You can learn<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more about that here: <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html">http://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html</a>. Things like Anaconda<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Canopy come with a lot of extra scientific libraries, the most interesting of which are<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, IPython, and pandas.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your'e curious about ipythonblocks, that's all actually in a file called ipythonblocks.py in<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the python/ipythonblocks directory.<br
/><br
/>Working with strings (split, etc)...<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading files means working with strings, something Python is awesome at. Often when<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you read a file the data are split into columns separated by some delimiter, e.g. white<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space or commas. .split() is used to separate a string into a list of individual strings so that<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can process each of the data points separately.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example 'a s d f'.split() -&gt; ['a', 's', 'd', 'f'], 'a,s,d,f'.split(',') -&gt; ['a', 's', 'd', 'f'].<br
