/><br
/><ul><li>This is one of the simplest yet easiest to read cheat sheets for shell commands I've been able to find: <a href="http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~pbeerli/classes/isc3313_files/UnixCheatSheet.pdf">http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~pbeerli/classes/isc3313_files/UnixCheatSheet.pdf</a><ul><li>If you're not terribly comfortable working in the command line I strongly recommend keeping this up.&nbsp; While very simple, this represents probably 75% of the commands I use on a daily basis.</li></ul
></li
><li>This one is pretty good too: <a href="http://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf">http://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf</a><ul><li>It's denser, but more complete. I don't think there's anything I use on a regular basis that's not on</li
><li>&nbsp;there (except of course for Python ;)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Git Bash provides a UNIX-like shell for Windows users<ul><li>(I use this all the time when I'm doing development on Windows)</li></ul
></li
><li>We teach the command line for a number of reasons, at least one of which is that a lot of software scientists write work in plain text<br/><br
/></li
><li>Navigating the filesystem with the shell:<ul><li>pwd -- "present working directory"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I?"</li
><li>ls -- "list"&nbsp; "What is in here?"</li
><li>cd &lt;directory_name&gt; -- "change directories"&nbsp; "I want to go to there"<ul><li>You can always type "cd" with no additional arguments to get back to your home directory</li
><li>"cd ~" also takes you to your home directory</li></ul
></li
><li><b>If you're note sure how to use a command type "&lt;command name&gt; --help" (that's with two dashes before help).&nbsp; Most commands support a --help option.&nbsp; Try "ls --help"</b></li
><li>You can use a wildcard character like * (shift-8 on most U.S. keyboards) to match multiple files.&nbsp; For example "ls *.txt"&nbsp; will list all files in your directory that end ".txt"<ul><li>You can use square brackets to match a specific set of characters like<ul><li>ls [ab]*&nbsp;&nbsp; will match anything starting with a or b</li></ul
></li
><li>You can use curly brackets { }&nbsp; to match a list of "sub-strings":<ul><li>ls *.{txt,doc}&nbsp;&nbsp; will match anything ending with .txt or .doc</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>This page has a good summary of the major directories in the Unix hierarchical directory structure: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_directory_structure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_directory_structure</a></li
><li>Use the find command to search for files across multiple directories.<ul><li>For example: find . -name '*.txt' to find all .txt files in your current directory and in the directories "below" it in the hierarchy<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Useful shell commands<ul><li>You can use the "which" command to find out the path corresponding to a particular executable.&nbsp; For example, you can do "which python" to find out where python is running from.&nbsp; This could be very useful if you have several versions of Python on your computer.</li
><li>The "echo" command echoes text back to you.&nbsp; So if you type in the terminal window</li></ul
></li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "hello world"<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will print "hello world" in your terminal.&nbsp; This might seem rather silly, but it can be&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quite useful for printing environment variables, piping text to other commands, or in&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shell scripts (we'll talk about pipe more later).<br
/><ul><li>A useful command is "echo $PATH".&nbsp; This shows you what your path is.&nbsp;<ul><li>$ PATH is the special list of directories that the shell searches in for a program when you run a program.&nbsp; For example, when you type "ls" the shell finds "/bin" in $PATH and finds a file called /bin/ls&nbsp; and executes that file<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Examining files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li
><li>There are many commands to quickly examine files on the command line.</li
><li>One such command is "cat" (short for concatenate).&nbsp; You can do "cat filename.txt" to see the contents of filename.txt.</li
><li>However, cat displays the entire file on your screen, which may not be ideal if you have a large file.&nbsp; If you use the "less" command, you can scroll through the text.&nbsp; For example, you could do "less filename.txt".&nbsp; "less" uses the same commands as "man".&nbsp; So you can type "q", to quit the program.</li
><li>Some other useful keyboard commands in the "less" program:<ul><li>g -- Go to the begging of the file</li
><li>G -- G to the *end* of the file</li
><li>q -- Quit</li
><li>/&nbsp; -- Search (type / followed by the word you want to search for)<ul><li>In search mode type 'n' to go the the next match<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Moving/Copying/Deleting files</li
><li>mv&nbsp; -- move (or rename) a file or directory</li
><li>cp&nbsp;&nbsp; -- copy a file&nbsp; ( use -r&nbsp; for "recursive" to copy a directory )</li
><li>rm&nbsp;&nbsp; -- remove a file&nbsp; ( use -r again for "recursive" to remove a directory )</li
><li>You can use "rm -i" command to use the interactive mode for removing.&nbsp; This might prevent you from accidentally deleting something important.</li
><li>Be really careful with all of these commands, you can easily overwrite files!!!&nbsp; Even "cp" can overwrite files, if you copy a file to a fiename that corresponds to a pre-existing file.<br/><br
/></li
><li>Counting words</li
><li>wc file1 file2 - counts the number of words in file1 and file2<br/><br
/></li
><li>Viewing parts of files</li
><li>head - for viewing the beginning of a file</li
><li>tail - for viewing the end of a file</li
><li>if you want to use a full text editor, you can try nano, vi (vim), or Emacs.&nbsp; nano is a ligthweight simple editor.&nbsp; vi/vim and Emacs are more heavy duty and take some time to learn.&nbsp; vi/vim, in particular, is not very intuitive and has a steep learning curve, but it's useful to know a few basic commands because it is frequently a default editor in Unix environments.<br/><br
/></li
><li>Piping</li
><li>You can use the pipe symbol | to string commands together</li
><li>For example, "wc * | tail -n 1" would count the words for all the files in the current directory and then pass that output to tail which shows you the last line<br/><br
/></li
><li>Sort</li
><li>sort - command that sorts lines of text</li
><li>example, "sort -k 3 -n" sorts on the 3rd column in numerical order.&nbsp; The -k specifies the column number and -n specifies numerical&nbsp;<br/><br
/></li
><li>Shell scripts</li
><li>If you use a particular command a lot, you can write a shell script and run it as an executable file.&nbsp; A bash script starts with "#!/bin/bash"</li
><li>Don't forget to make your shell script executable by using the "chmod" command.<br/><br
/></li
><li>Searching files</li
><li>grep - command for searching inside files (not file names, the content)</li
><li>grep is most powerful when you use it in combination with other commands.&nbsp; For example, "tail filename | grep grape" would get the end of a file and return the lines containing "grape"<br/><br
/></li></ul
><u>Day 1: Afternoon</u><br
/><br
/><ul><li>SSH<ul><li>a secure protocol for sending data across a network</li
><li>can be used to securely connect to another computer or prove your identity</li
><li>based on private and public key pairs</li
><li>we'll see that SSH keys are useful for Git (a version control system)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Version control<ul><li>examples of version control systems: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial</li
><li>Dropbox, Google Drive, etc are not version control</li
><li>You can do version control for yourself (one person), but version control is most useful for 2 or more people</li
><li>example application: collaborating on a paper<ul><li>you can edit the same file simulataneously with another person.</li
><li>The version control system keeps track of files and their different versions and who edited which files.&nbsp; This way of working is better than email.</li></ul
></li
><li>We'll focus on distributed version control systems (examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar).&nbsp; Everyone has a copy of the repository.&nbsp; This is the modern way of doing version control.&nbsp; Older version controls (like Subversion) use a central repository.</li
><li>Git and GitHub are not the same thing.&nbsp; Git is a version control system whereas GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Git - The basics<ul><li>Don't worry if Git seems hard.&nbsp; Because it is!&nbsp; It was made for developers by developers.&nbsp; It is pretty complex and not easy to learn, but the reward is that it is very powerful.&nbsp; Also, lots of people use it including people who write scientific software.&nbsp; Knowing Git makes it easy for you to get someone's code and modify it.</li
><li>Setup your git configuration with the commands.&nbsp; Make sure the email is the same as what you used for your GitHub account.&nbsp; &lt;editor&gt; is whatever text editor you like, for example "vi", "emacs", "nano"</li></ul
></li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git config --global user.name "John Doe"<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git config --global core.editor &lt;editor&gt;<br
/><ul><li>Generate SSH key pair on your computer</li
><li>Put your ssh public key in your GitHub account</li
><li>Erik, once he has your GitHub username, will give you write access to the demo Git repository on GitHub</li
><li>Clone the umass-example repository onto your computer:&nbsp;</li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git clone git@github.com:iguananaut/umass-example.git<br
/><ul><li>Notice we used an address that started with git@github.com...&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows us to both read AND write to the repository.&nbsp; If you use an address that starts with http... you might only have read access to the repository</li
><li>The hidden directory .git stores the history of your entire repository.&nbsp; Generally, you don't want to mess around with this.</li
><li>Add a new file called "top-things-to-learn.md"&nbsp; Edit this file however you want.</li
><li>Run the command "git status".&nbsp; Notice that the output says that "top-things-to-learn.md" is untracked.</li
><li>Use Git to add this file to the staging area: "git add top-things-to-learn.md"</li
><li>Run "git status" again to see what has changed.&nbsp; Notice that "top-things-to-learn.md"&nbsp; is now listed as "changes to be committed".</li
><li>Commit the file with a helpful descriptive message explaining what you did in this file:&nbsp;</li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git commit -m "my message"<br
/><ul><li>Run "git status" again and pay close attention to the output.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li
><li>Edit the "top-things-to-learn.md" file and add some text.</li
><li>Run "git diff" to see the difference between your current version of "top-things-to-learn.md" and your previously commited version.&nbsp; New lines are prefaced by "+" and deleted lines are prefaced by "-"</li
><li>Run "git status" and notice that it lists "top-things-to-learn.md" as a modified file, but that this file has not yet been added to the commit.&nbsp; ("no changes added to commit")</li
><li>Run "git add top-things-to-learn.md" followed by "git commit -m "another message" where "another message" should be replaced by a description of what you did to the file.</li
><li>Run "git log" to see the history of your repository.&nbsp; Notice the unique long hexadecimal numbers corresponding to each commit.&nbsp; These numbers can be useful for reverting to old versions.<ul><li>A handy variation on the above command is "git log --oneline" which produces an abbreviated log.</li></ul
></li
><li>Let's purposely make a mistake.&nbsp; Open up "README.md" and type in some random letters.</li
><li>Let's commit this change with the command&nbsp;</li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git commit -a -m "something"<br
/><ul><li>The flag -a is a shortcut which is equivalent to applying "git add" to all modified tracked files, followed by "git commit".&nbsp; Be careful using this command because you may add files that you don't want to be committed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li
><li>Whoops, we didn't want to commit this change.&nbsp; We can undo this by using the "git reset" command.&nbsp; "git reset" allows us to rewind history back to a particular "snapshot".&nbsp; Use "git log --oneline" to find the number corresponding to the commit you want to revert to.&nbsp; Then use "git reset commit_number" to go back to that version.&nbsp; For example:</li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git reset c8d6a28<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your particular number will probably be different<br
/><ul><li>Open up "README.md" in your text editor and delete the garbage text you entered earlier.</li
><li>If you go to the GitHub website for the repository and click on the "Commits" tab, you see GitHub's version of the git log</li
><li>For an instructive lesson, thry "git pull".&nbsp; Depending on what files you changed, you might get a message about needing to merge.&nbsp; This is what happens when the GitHub repository and your local repository have conflicting histories.&nbsp; If you get a message about merging, then you need to go into your text editor and fix it by hand.</li
><li>OK, let's rewind.&nbsp; So do 'git log --oneline' to see the commit numbers.&nbsp; Note the number that corresponds to Erik's last commit.&nbsp; Then do 'git reset --hard commit_number' using the number we just mentioned.</li
><li>Someone in the class should push to the GitHub repository.&nbsp; Make some changes to files, add them to the staging area and commit them as we did before, then run "git push".&nbsp; Aha, a file was changed!</li
><li>We can now pull those changes into our own local repository.&nbsp; Run "git pull"</li
><li>Now we'll have a push-pull party.&nbsp; Everyone will be doing this at the same time, so you may or may not be able to push without a merge conflict.<ul><li>1) --&gt; Edit a file and save it.</li
><li>2) git add &lt;filename&gt;</li
><li>3) git commit -m "message"</li
><li>4) git pull</li
><li>5) --&gt; Edit and save the file again</li
><li>6) --&gt; if you get a message about a merging conflict, resolve the conflict by opening up the file in the text editor and editing the file to the way you like it.</li
><li>7) git commit -m "message"</li
><li>8) git push</li
><li>9) if your push fails, go back to (1)</li></ul
></li></ul
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note this is not a very realistic situation.&nbsp; You wouldn't normally have ~40 people&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pushing to the same file in the same repository at approximately the same time.<br
/><ul><li>You can have a GitHub repository just for yourself; this is not a bad idea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br
/></li
><li>Git - Branching</li
><li>One of the killer features of Git is branches.&nbsp; A branch allows you to work on a modification in an environment separate from your "master" copy.</li
><li>To understand how branches work, it's best to look at a diagram.&nbsp; For example, see <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging</a></li
><li>Typically, you always have a branch called "master".&nbsp; By convention, this is supposed to be consistent with the GitHub repository.&nbsp; When you want to do an experiment or make modifications, it's a good idea to create a specific branch for that, which is not "master".</li
><li>Make a branch for an experiment by running the command "git checkout -b experiment"</li
><li>Run "git branch" to see what branches you have.&nbsp; The branch with * in front of it is the branch you're on.&nbsp; You should see two branches listed, master and experiment.&nbsp; The * should be in front of experiment.&nbsp; So now you are on the "experiment" branch.</li
><li>Now that you are on the "experiment" branch, create a new file.&nbsp; Then add the file and commit these changes.</li
><li>Now run "git checkout master"&nbsp; If you do "ls" to list the files in the directory, you'll notice that your new file disappeared!!&nbsp; Don't worry; it's still there.&nbsp; If you do "git checkout experiment", you'll see the file again.</li
><li>Let's merge your branches together.&nbsp; Do "git checkout master" followed by "git merge experiment."&nbsp; The merge between "master" and "experiment" should happen automatically since there is no conflict when you add a new file in a branch.</li
><li>If there happened to be a conflict when you did the merge between the "master" and "experiment" branches, that you would resolve that conflict in a text file, the same as we did when you were pushing to the GitHub repo.&nbsp; The only difference is that the conflicts are completely local, rather than between you and the remote GitHub repository.</li
><li>Often, after you merge a branch with master, you don't need that branch anymore.&nbsp; You can delete it with the -d flag.&nbsp; For example, "git branch -d experiment"</li
><li>Unfortunately, we didn't have time to cover rebasing in Git. :(<br/><br
/></li
><li>Why is version control important</li
><li>Reproducible research - what if someone asks you about your result in a paper from a year ago and wants your code to reproduce it?&nbsp; If you've modified the code since then and haven't kept track of the changes, there is no way to reproduce that work.<br/><br
/></li
><li>Tomorrow</li
><li>tomorrow we'll be doing Python</li
><li>Try the command "ipython notebook" in your terminal window and make sure it works.<br/><br
