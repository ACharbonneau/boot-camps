Slow the first day and fast the second day +1
Shell section was slow +2
Afternoon sessions were fast [ed.: Git and testing/design]
Too slow sometimes
More time on Git, still slightly mysterious
More time on testing/design
Testing/design felt rushed [ed.: we started a bit late]
Could have looked up a lot of Python syntax stuff, maybe more time on abstractions and good practices
Bit fast at times +1
Bit slow sometimes +1
Wish the boot camp was longer
