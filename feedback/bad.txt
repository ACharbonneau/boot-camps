Skipped some basics I could have used
Python intro was a bit slow +1
Matplotlib was very fast +1
Will take a while for me to use this on my own
Pace on some topics was fast
A lot of material for two days
Don't assume everyone will have local wifi access (need guest access)
Some parts were very slow
Be nice to have a component where we play with our own data
More on NumPy/SciPy/pandas
Git was too complicated
More time for Python would be nice
