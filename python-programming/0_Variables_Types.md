Python is an interpreted language. That means that there is no separate compilation step. Let's start and bring up the Python prompt:

```python
   $ python
   Python 2.7.3 (default, Dec 18 2012, 13:50:09)
   [GCC 4.5.3] on cygwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
```

Let's get Python to talk to us:

```python
   $ python
   Python 2.7.3 (default, Dec 18 2012, 13:50:09)
   [GCC 4.5.3] on cygwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
```
