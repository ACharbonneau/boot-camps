# Python 1 Data Types: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples, and Reading Files

Python is an interpreted language. That means that there is no separate compilation step. Let's start and bring up the Python prompt:

```python
   Python 2.7.3 (default, Dec 18 2012, 13:50:09)
   [GCC 4.5.3] on cygwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
```

Let's get Python to talk to us:

```python
   print "Hello world!"
   print 2 + 2
   print 'Thomas ' + 'Mann'
```

Python does not require us to declare variables as they are created when we first use them:

```python
   a = 1
   print a
   a = 'pigeon'
   print a
   a = 2 + 7 
   print a
```

Variables in Python are not typed as you can see. They can be thought of as being just names. However, beware that Python does not assume default variables - you have to assign them before use:

```python
   print b
```
