couldn't run the VM on underpowered computer
don't see why Python is better than R
would like a longer bootcamp with more focus on Python
didn't want to learn Python
would like to give anonymous feedback
didn't catch some important details that held things up
have better setup instructions, test scripts
Python instruction was too slow/basic
got left behind sometimes
not sure how to integrate git into workflow, have practical demos, case studies
hard to type/listen/watch all at once
would be nice to have a data cleaning example, workflow example
could have sped up introductory topics
have more content summaries, workflow visualizations
reading suggestions to follow up bootcamp
wanted to see object oriented programming/calling C code
