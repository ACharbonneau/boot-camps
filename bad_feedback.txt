don't know how to apply git to work
covered too much material
group felt too large for number of helpers
felt unprepared for git instruction
couldn't run VM, add system reqs
python level was too easy
need well defined goals for exercises
group people by experience
would have liked a more detailed description of course
didn't get any emails on the waitlist
getting info ahead of time
whole thing too fast
topics jumped around
maybe too language (Python) dependent, no objects
burnt out at end of first day (fast)
9-4:30 draining, more breaks between topics
didn't expect to program at end, was right
switch morning git with afternoon python on 2nd day
not clear that mac users needed to install software ahead, why certain steps
some hard to follow along, relies on previous success with commands
more relevant examples to audience, day to day data/problems
what was xcode for?
falling behind in python - 2 tiered exercises
documentation needs comments
is there help for release management?
advanced math?
third day - integrative exercise, case study - start to finish
    (optional, weekend)
follow up project, final suggested homework assignment
