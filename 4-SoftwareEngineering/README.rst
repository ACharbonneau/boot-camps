Building a Library of Code you Trust
====================================

Suppose we're going to be dealing a lot with these animal count files,
and doing many different kinds of analysis with them. In the introduction
to Python lesson we wrote a function that reads these files but it's stuck
off in an IPython notebook. We could copy and paste it into a new notebook
every time we want to use it but that gets tedious and makes it difficult to
add features to the function. The ideal solution would be to keep the
function in one spot and use it over and over again from many different places.
Python modules to the rescue!
