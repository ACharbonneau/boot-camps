Dev Notes
=========

Things we want to demonstrate:

- write lots of small tools (functions)
- document your code
- test your code, including TDD
- debugging

 - build in a crash somewhere and explain tracebacks
 - do an import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

Create a few utilities to work with the `*animal.txt` files from
introductory Python.

Put all the functionality in one file and make small scripts that import
from that file, parse command line arguments, and do stuff.

- average number of an animal seen per sighting
- total number of an animal seen over the season
- all the sightings on a given day

Students may want an IPython notebook open as a scratch pad.

Lesson Plan
-----------

1. Demonstrate putting code in a `.py` file and running it.
2. Demonstrate importing a module (maybe `math` or `glob`)

Exercise:
