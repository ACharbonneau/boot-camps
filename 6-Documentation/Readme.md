Just like version control and testing, documenting your code is the most
important thing you can do as a software developer. As we have seen in
previous sessions with other tools, good documentation is a sublime
experience that should permeate your code.

Documentation is important because it is [the only way that 90% of
people will ever interact with you or your
code](http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-writing-great-documentation-4899042).
In fact, it is the only way that scales up; there are only so many
emails that you can write.

What is disturbing is that documentation is a forgotten after thought
for most developers. It turns out that being able to write software and
being able to write in your primary spoken language are different
skills. Luckily, we are academics here so it is in our nature to publish
/ write. We have no excuse for bad documentation.

**The Many Stages of Documentation:**

1.  Readmes
2.  User Guides
3.  Developer Guides
4.  Code Comments
5.  API Documentation
6.  Auto-documentation

## Readmes

The omnipresent `README` file is typically a plaintext file that sits
next to the code. They typically may contain markup but are often quite
terse. The point of a readme file is to provide only the most basic of
information to the user / developer
