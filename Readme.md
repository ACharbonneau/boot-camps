# Welcome

**Software Carpentry Bootcamp 2012 at UC Berkeley**

## How ?

Before you come to the bootcamp, you will need to bring a laptop with which to follow along interactively with the 
tutorials. In order to do this, you will need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), download 
[this virtual machine image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/SWC_JHU2012/swc_jhu2012_r03.ova), and open the image 
using VirtualBox.

By doing so, you will have, on your laptop, a virtual environment pre-loaded with all of the necessary 
software (a terminal, text editors, git, ipython, numpy, and other python packages) for the tutorial. 

## Where?

   

## When ?

The bootcamp will last from 9am to 4:30pm on October 20 and 21. There
will be an hour lunch break at 12:15pm on both days (lunch not provided). 
There will also be coffee breaks intermittently throughout the days.

## Who?

The bootcamp will be led by Katy Huff and Matt Davis. It was organized by 
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), an online
compendium of resources for scientific computation.
