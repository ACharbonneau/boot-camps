* More actual discussion of software engineering best practices
* Starting a little later in the day
* Less focus on basic Python and more on design philosopy
* Numpy details were too much!
* Would have liked more plotting and sooner
* Was hoping to address how to scale up from smaller projects to larger
  projects with more files
* Not sure who the target audience is for shell
* Shell, then version control, then some Python, then run Python in the shell--etc. Simulate a real development workflow.
