Scripps computational info
--------------------------
* IT has set up a temporary server for use by class participants.  The server name is it-test7.scripps.edu
 * iPython Notebook *should* be available at http://it-test7.scripps.edu:8888 (NOTE: only available from the Scripps network)
* IT also invites users who want to do more computational work to request accounts on garabaldi
 * To request an account, please send an email to hpc_ca@scripps.edu
 * Account will provide access to two nodes for interactive use, and also the potential of using our high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.
* IT also maintains two general-purpose compute servers: home.scripps.edu, app.scripps.edu
 * Both are older machines that currently aren't well supported.
 * We suggest you *not* use these servers to use/practice the skills learned in this workshop
 * To encourage IT to make these more up-to-date and publicized resources, use it-test7
* Also, sign up for the mailing list of the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) Affinity Group
 * Web sign up: http://lists.scripps.edu/majorcool.cgi
 * Or, send email to majordomo@scripps.edu with 'subscribe cbb' (no quotes) in the message body
