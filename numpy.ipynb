      "# Introduction to Numpy\n",
      "[Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) is the fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It contains list like objects that work like arrays, matrices, and data tables. This is how scientists typically expect data to behave. Numpy also provides linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is the reigning library for 2D (with budding support for 3D) scientific plotting in Python. It produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.  Between Numpy and Matplotlib, much of MATLAB's functionality can be replaced with Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you primarily want to work with tables of data, [Pandas](pandas), which depends on Numpy, is probably the module that you want to start with."

      "Python was never designed originally for scientific computing, and contains many high-level abstractions necessary to enable its enormously flexible object-oriented interface.  In Python, storing most integers requires more than just 4-8 bytes.  It also requires at least a couple pointers per-integer.  Performing a calculation on two numbers requires one or two bytecode operations, each of which can take dozens of CPU instructions for each pass through the Python eval loop.  And when it comes to looping and index operations of Python lists the situation is even more dire.\n",
