Good
====

* Learning the command line basics.
* Background about how computers work.
* Really liked git.
* Helpful for research.
* Tied together concepts from different programming languages and experience.

Bad
===

* Screen size made scrolling difficult.
* Some things went too fast, were hard to keep up with.
* Would be good to have some reading suggestions to get started with.
* Expanded installations instructions please.
* We should have had instructions for sharing notebooks.
* Maybe git should be taught first.
* Students falling behind from what was being typed on the screen, things scrolling 
  out of view too fast or changing in-place.  We really need to only show sessions for
  which we already have a record available on github they can fall back on.
* Make sure we introduce the comment markers at the very beginning, and also explain
  how to create text cells for long-form notes.  Students can thus use this to 
  make their own notes while the session is going on.
* Our example scripts need to be heavily commented in terms of their logic, so that
  when students read them they have a bit more hand-holding for later understanding.
* Build exercises with explanations that motivate each step for the work.
