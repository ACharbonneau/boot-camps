# 10. Do you have any other comments?

I thought it was great, well run, good space. Intro to python was very useful and at a good pace for a beginner like myself (probably painfully slow for those who know python).

I think that it should be more thought about who his course is for. A scientist who wants to learn and use programming in their research or an individual who is already familiar with programming but not ecessarily python. Thius way the course would not be too fast for beginners nor too slow for people aleady programming.

I really liked the effective setup with one screen for every table and a high number of helpers such that there was always someone around to quickly help if a question or problem occured.

It might be a good idea to do a bootcamp specific for elder researchers that might need a little more time to grasp some concepts than their younger counterparts. I don't mean this suggestion to sound discriminating, but I could see someone next to me going through a similar situation. Overall everything went smoothly and all the topics were very useful. Also I would like to thank all volunteers for their great job helping us out.

The VMplayer virtual machine approach to software setup seems to be the best one, and should be more strongly encouraged to ensure all participants have the same system setup. Also the virtual machine should have a variety of editors installed by default.

The venue was excellent, as were the instructors, helpers, attendees, and sponsors. :)

A third day in which to bring everything together would be useful, I feel. Despite being quite familiar with python (though new to versioning, writing makefiles and inexperienced with bash) I found it hard to finish the 4-step 'wrap up' at the end. This is a very good and potentially useful activity, but only if there is sufficient time for most people to complete, or come close to completing, the task. Perhaps more advanced 'wrap up' questions could be provided for those who are able to quickly complete the first set. I would actually prefer this to a third day that was domain-specfic.

Its well worth while, well thought through, and a good thing. My suggestions are that talks with live demos being typed by participants works very well only in the bash session when commands are easy and self-contained. Better to have short talks with concepts, then a script that people follow, then a further talk. Too many concurrent threads of communication were active at a time I think - group, helpers talking; speaker talking... (But I can't type and talk at the same time anyway!) I'd enjoy contributing to this in future if circumstances permit. There was huge energy from all involved. Well done!

Too much time was given to complete easy practical tasks. While some lectures were rushed through, but overall I enjoyed the fast pace.
