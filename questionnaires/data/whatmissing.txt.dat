# 5. What else should the boot camp have covered? (What was missing from the boot camp?)

More info on make.

I would have liked to see more advanced features of the bash shell.

Networking oriented bash & python contents. I understand this might not be interesting for BioSciences for example. Also sed and awk might be good tools for everyone.

How to use the internet to find answers. in Python the string % operator. In shell: how to number the lines of file (useful later when we're doing tracebacks in Python).

Other versioning systems, e.g. git, would have been useful, as BitBucket provides access to them and I kno of other researchers who use git (in fact, I am not personally aware of any that use mercurial, but several who use git. This is probably just a (huge) selection bias, though.) It's a huge topic, and the documentation is... usually almost sufficient, but slightly more in-depth coverage of matplotlib would have been helpful, e.g. how to save files, change their sizes for publication.

I think showing examples of the scientific libraries in python would have been useful e.g. numpy ans scipy

I think databases are worth inflicting on people- metadata is starting to bite many people. Could mix it with an example illustrating what archive services need??

More complex uses of matplotlib. What are the advantages of python over other languages? How fast is python?
